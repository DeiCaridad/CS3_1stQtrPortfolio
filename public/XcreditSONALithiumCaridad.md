3. **Reflection Paragraphs**
    - This year's SONA addressed and tackled many issues, both national and regional. Among these addressed issues, there were 2 topics that BBM mentioned multiple times during the SONA: education and healthcare. In his speech, BBM emphasized learning gaps in Filipino youth, giving teachers more support and resources, scholarships, and more. Regarding health, BBM mentioned allocating 1.7 billion pesos for essential medicines, expanding public hospitals, and more.
    - Something that I did not expect in SONA '25 was BBM addressing the price of rice, specifically when he mentioned of the price of 1 kilo of rice, which was set to 20. According to BBM, this doesn't cause any losses to local farmers. Personally, this unexpected change is benificial to both local farmers and citizens as the farmers still make a profit while the other filipinos get cheaper rice.
