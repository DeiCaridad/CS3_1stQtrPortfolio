# Dei's Answers to the Reflection/s

## Questions and Answers

### **List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.**
1. Loops (do while, while, for) in JS 
    - We went over three different types of loops: do while, while, and for, each with their differences. From what I remember, loop structures, especially ones involving while and for, were used in many coding tasks in the previous years, so knowledge about them and how they are used was already known. Additionally, the syntax is very similar to the syntax used in JS. However, bits and pieces of trivia, like how only having "; ;" in a for loop creates an infinite loop, was something new and contributed to my overall knowledge on the topic. 
        
    - Post-test and pre-test loops were also discussed in our lecture/discussion on loops. This was a relatively new topic for me, and probably the rest of the class. However, this topic was relatively easy to grasp thanks to personal study and how our teacher described them. 
    
2. Functions 
    - The syntax for functions was almost the same as C++, so previous knowledge of functions can be applied here. Their use, how to call them, and how variables can be inputted into the functions were also discussed and used in a majority of previous coding tasks, especially in the latter half of last year.

3. If and else if statements
    - A fundamental topic that was discussed to us in previous years, so we have prior knowledge on this. The tasks and activities done during class helped further enhance the practical usage and knowledge on the topic.

4. Variable declaration
    - Even though variable declaration in JS is different from other languages, its very simple to understand. Learning and using variables was simple due to only having "let", "var", and "const".

5. Logic Structures
    - This was taught to us in grade 7 and 8, so this was easy to grasp. We also had many exercises in these years so experience here is plenty.

### **List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.**

1. Markdown files
    - Using markdown files is relatively new so my skill and knowledge on this is limited. The different styling options and headers are similar to those in communication apps like Discord though some parts like the headers are different.

2. HTML 
    - Though HTML was taught to us well, using them in practice is difficult for me. HTML is for me a very unique style of programming, especially with the "<>" characters being very common. Additionally, things like creating buttons, gathering input data, and getting links were a bit confusing because of how different the syntax is compared to the other programming languages we were taught.

3. Debugging 
    - One of the graded tasks we were assigned to had us debug a program. This task took a very long time to do due to its difficulty, even with some help. This is a skill that I would mosst definitely need to work on.

4. Unique JS program lines/syntax
    - This more specifically refers to things like ternary operators and arrow functions. These things are very unique and were hard to grasp, even up until now.

5. Switch statements
    - Though I do have knowledge and some skill on using switch(), I think that I can still improve and practice these skills more. I was also more used to using if and else instead of this.

### **Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.**

1. I plan to review and go over online materials on the topic to let myself be more comfortable in using unfamiliar keywords and other practical material used in coding. I also plan to practice implementing these in compilers to be more familiar with the usage of that item.

### **In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?**

1. Effective activities
    - Non-Graded Exercises
    - Kahoot

    - The non-graded tasks given to us during the CS periods gave us an opportunity to hone our skills without having to worry about grades. This also gave us the opportunity to ask for help and assistance for practical applications of our lessons. The Kahoot games during class also gave us a chance to learn and review lessons as well as have a fun light hearted challenge for the class.

2. Non-Effective/least effective activities
    - Diagnostic test
    - Exams

    - Though the Diagnostic Test was effective in gauging the aptitude of b2029 students, it was one of the least effective activities as the nature of it being graded gave me some concern since my grades would be affected by this. It was also the first time a diagnostic test was used as a graded task. Compared to the other tasks/activities we had this quarter, this would be one of the least effective ones.

    - Personally, the exams were effective in seeing how much we have learned in the quarter. However, I often tend to forget lessons after exams. So, compared to the other activities, this was one of the least effective activities.
