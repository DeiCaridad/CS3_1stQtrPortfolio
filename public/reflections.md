## Questions and Answers

### **List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with two to five sentences.**
1. Loops (do while, while, for) in JS 
    - We went over three different types of loops: do while, while, and for, each with their differences. From what I remember, loop structures, especially ones involving while and for, were used in many coding tasks in the previous years, so knowledge about them and how they are used was already known. Additionally, the syntax is very similar to the syntax used in JS. However, bits and pieces of trivia, like how only having "; ;" in a for loop creates an infinite loop, was something new and contributed to my overall knowledge on the topic. 
        
    - Post-test and pre-test loops were also discussed in our lecture/discussion on loops. This was a relatively new topic for me, and probably the rest of the class. However, this topic was relatively easy to grasp thanks to personal study and how our teacher described them. 
    
2. Functions 
    - The syntax for functions was almost the same as C++, so previous knowledge of functions can be applied here. Their use, how to call them, and how variables can be inputted into the functions were also discussed and used in a majority of previous coding tasks, especially in the latter half of last year.

3. If and else if statements
    - A fundamental topic that was discussed to us in previous years, so we have prior knowledge on this. The tasks and activities done during class helped further enhance the practical usage and knowledge on the topic.

4. Variable declaration
    - Even though variable declaration in JS is different from other languages, its very simple to understand. Learning and using variables was simple due to only having "let", "var", and "const".

5. 

### **List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.**

1. Markdown files
    - Using markdown files is relatively new so my skill and knowledge on this is limited. The different styling options and headers are
2. HTML 
    - Though HTML was taught to us well, using them in practice is difficult for me. HTML is for me a very unique style of programming, especially with the "<>" characters being very common. Additionally, things like creating buttons, gathering input data, and getting links were a bit confusing because of how different the syntax is compared to the other programming languages we were taught.
3. 

### **Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.**

1. I plan to review and go over online materials on the topic to let myself be more comfortable in using unfamiliar keywords and other practical material used in coding. I also plan to practice implementing these in compilers to be more familiar with the usage of that item.

### **In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?**
